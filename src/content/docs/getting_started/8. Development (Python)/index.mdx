Along with the C++ API, eCAL offers a great pyhton integration. You will find this especially usefull if you are more familiar with python than C++ or you just want to quickly develop anything that doesn't require that extreme level of control and performance of C++.

So let's quickly dive into Python and eCAL with some Hello World Examples!
