title: 8.1 Hello World (Python)
---

import { Code } from 'astro-expressive-code/components';
import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

import sndHelloWorldPY from '../../../../assets/files/hello_world_python/hello_world_snd.py?raw';
import recHelloWorldPY from '../../../../assets/files/hello_world_python/hello_world_rec.py?raw';

While eCAL is written in C++, it also offers a great python integration.
Again, we are going to explore that integration by implementing a Hello World Application, that sends the string "Hello World" to an eCAL topic.

<Aside type="caution" title="Important">
   The eCAL Python integration is called ``python3-ecal5``.
   With the ``5`` at the end.
   The other name has already been taken by another package.
</Aside>   

## 8.1.1 Dependencies

First, you have to install some more development dependencies:

- Windows:
    - Python 3 64-bit (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    - The eCAL python integration. Choose the appropiate version from the [All releases](TODO-LINK) and download the `.whl` file. Open a command prompt in your donwload directory and install the python whl with:
        ```shell
            pip install ecal5-****-win_amd64.whl
        ```

- Ubuntu:
    - Python 3: 
        ```shell
            sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
        ```
    - The eCAL Python integration.
        - If you have installed eCAL from a [PPA](/getting_started/2_installing_ecal/#221-automatically-install-ecal-from-a-ppa):
            ```shell
                sudo apt install python3-ecal5
            ```
        - If you are not using a PPA, choose the appropiate version from the [All releases](TODO-LINK) and download the `.whl` file. Open a terminal in your donwload directory and install the python whl with:
            ```shell
                sudo pip3 install ecal5-*-linux_x86_64.whl
            ```


## 8.1.2 Hello World Publisher

Somewhere on your hard drive create an empty directory and create a file `hello_world_snd.py` with the following content:

<Code code={sndHelloWorldPY} lang="python" title="hello_world_snd.py"/>

<Aside title="What is happening here?">
    - **Line 4-5** imports the eCAL Core and the eCAL String publisher (In this tutorial we only want to send raw strings). eCAL supports multiple message formats.
  
    - **Line 9** Initialized the eCAL API. The name of our eCAL Process will be "Python Hello World Publisher". This name will be visible in the eCAL Monitor, once the Process is running.
  
    - **Line 13** creates an eCAL Publisher. An eCAL Process can create multiple publishers (and multiple subscribers). The topic we are publishing on will be "hello_world_python_topic".
  
    - **line 19** Creates an infinite publish-loop. eCAL supports a stop-signal; when an eCAL Process is stopped, ``ecal_core.ok()`` will return false.
     
    - **Line 23** will publish our message and send it to other eCAL Processes that have subscribed on the topic.
  
    - **Line 31** de-initializes eCAL. You should always do that before your application exits.
</Aside>

Now execute your python hello world script and take a look at the eCAL Monitor!
You will see the "Python Hello World Publisher" process and the "hello_world_python_topic".

- Windows: ``python hello_world_snd.py``
- Ubuntu: ``python3 hello_world_snd.py``

## 8.1.3 Hello World Subscriber

For the subscriber, create another file `hello_world_rec.py` with the following content:

<Code code={sndHelloWorldPY} lang="python" title="hello_world_rec.py"/>

<Aside title="What is happening here?">
    - **Line 5** Imports the eCAL StringSubscriber class

    - **Line 8-9** Is the receive callback. This method will be called whenever a new message arrives.
     
    - **Line 16** creates an eCAL subscriber that listens to the "hello_world_python_topic".

    - **Line 19** adds the receive callback from above to the subscriber, so it can be called.
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution" title="Important">
    eCAL Receive callbacks run in the subscriber's receive thread.
    While the callback is running, the subscriber cannot receive new data.
    So, if your callback needs really long to compute, you may have to decouple your computations to not loose messages.
</Aside>

When you now execute ``hello_world_snd.py`` and ``hello_world_rec.py``, the receiver application will receive the messages sent by the sender.

Awesome, you have written your first eCAL publisher and subscriber with python!
In general however you will want to have a better way to structure your data than a raw string.
So let's head on to the next topic where we will check out protobuf!
