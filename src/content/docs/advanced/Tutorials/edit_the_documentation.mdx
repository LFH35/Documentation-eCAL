This documentation is createt with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and uses the Theme [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/sidebar/#custom-html-attributes).

In this tutorial we will teach you how to edit the documentation locally on your PC. For that we will use Visual Studio Code and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) which you will need for building the site and also for dev Preview.

<Aside type="tip">
    For small changes you can click <Badge text="Edit page" variant="note" size="medium" /> at the bottom of every Site.

<Steps>
1. Checkout the eCAL git repository:
    ```shell
        git clone https://github.com/eclipse-ecal/ecal.git
    ```

2. Download and install Visual Studio Code on your PC (it is available for Windows, Linux and macOS). https://code.visualstudio.com/

3. Download and install Node.js. https://nodejs.org/en

4. Navigate to the eCAL directory where the docs folder is located. Access the docs folder and install the requirements with npm.
    ```shell
        npm install
    ```

5. Now you can run:
    ```shell
        npm run dev
    ```
    for dev Preview in your Browser (http://localhost:4321)

6. Run:
    ```shell
        npm run build
    ```
    for Building the application, the Build files will be located at `/dist/..`
</Steps>

<Aside>
    For easier development with VS-Code we recommend to install some extensions:
    - Astro
    - Prettier - Code formatter
