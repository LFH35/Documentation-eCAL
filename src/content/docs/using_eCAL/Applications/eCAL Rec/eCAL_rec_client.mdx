The eCAL Rec Client is a command-line style application that gets remote controlled by an eCAL Rec Host Application (i.e. [eCAL Rec GUI](/using_ecal/applications/ecal-rec/ecal_rec_gui/) or [eCAL Rec CLI](/using_ecal/applications/ecal-rec/ecal_rec_cli/)).
Start this application on all machines that shall record topics in a distributed recording scenario.

<Aside>
   Usually you will not need to manually control the eCAL Rec Client, as eCAL Rec CLI provides all the same features and more; it basically has a built-in eCAL Rec Client.
