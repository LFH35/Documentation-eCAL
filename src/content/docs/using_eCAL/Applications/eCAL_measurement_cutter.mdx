   To learn more about the measurement format used by eCAL please check out the [eCAL Measurement Format](TODO-LINK) chapter.
</Aside>

eCAL Measurement Cutter is a Command Line Application used to manipulate eCAL measurements. 
The executable is `ecal_meas_cutter /.exe`.
It can trim measurements by time, exclude / include channels, modify base file names and split the measurement files by size.

<Aside>
   eCAL Measurement Cutter is available since eCAL 5.11.

## Usage

<Code code={measCutterUsageTXT} lang="txt" title="meas_cutter_usage.txt"/>

Now let's take them one by one and explain.

### 1. Input path (``-i, --input``)

The path to the measurement that we want to process. It can also be a path pointing to an `.ecalmeas` file.

<Aside type="caution" title="Important">
   Since the application can alter multiple measurements simultaneously, this argument can be given multiple times. But it also needs a matching number of output paths.

   Example: `-i measurement_1 -o output_measurement_1 -i measurement_2 -o output_measurement_2`
</Aside>

### 2. Output path (``-o, --output``)

The path where the converted measurement will be saved.

<Aside type="caution" title="Important">
   The application will create a folder called :file:`MEASUREMENT_CONVERTER` in the output path.

   If the folder already exists, it is important for it to be empty, otherwise the application will not continue.
</Aside>

### 3. Configuration file (``-c, --config``)

The application uses a YAML configuration file that describes the changes to be applied on the given measurement.

Let's see how this configuration file can look like.

<Code code={configYAML} lang="yml" title="config.yaml"/>

<Aside title="What will be the result by using this configuration file?">
   We will have a measurement with base file name :file:`measurement` with a maximum size of 1024 MB per file.
   It will have a duration of 10 seconds, from second 10 of the original measurement to second 20, excluding at the same time any channel containg the characters sequence :file:`Image` and :file:`V2X`, and the channel :file:`TrafficParticipantListPb`, if they exist in the measurement.
</Aside>

- **basename** : the base name of the `.hdf5` files
- **splitsize** : maximum size of the `.hdf5` files in Megabytes
- **trim** : specifies the fact that we want to trim the measurement, either at the start, the end or both
  
  - **start** \/ **end**  : specifies how the start/end will be calculated
  
    + **time** : the value that we want to use to trim the start/end
    + **base** : the reference point from where the new start/end is calculated
    + **scale** : the scale that we want to use
  
<Aside type="caution" title="Important">
   Possible values for **base**: start, end, absolute.
   The absolute value means that the timestamp from the measurement will be used.

   Possible values for **scale**: s, second, seconds, us, microsecond, microseconds, ms, millisecond, milliseconds.
</Aside>

- **include**\/**exclude** (mutually exclusive) : a YAML list describing the channel names that we want to include or exclude from a measurement.

<Aside>
   When trying to include/ exclude channels using regex, use `- re:`.
   Use one list item for one expression.
</Aside>

### 4. Save log (``-s, --save_log``)

When this flag is enabled, the application will also write its output in a log file.
This file can be found in the folder `log`, next to the executable.

### 5. Disable verbose (``-q, --quiet``)

When this flag is enabled, console output is disabled except for error messages.

### 6. Enable one file per topic (``--enable-one-file-per-topic``)

When this flag is enabled, each topic will be written in its own HDF5 file.
