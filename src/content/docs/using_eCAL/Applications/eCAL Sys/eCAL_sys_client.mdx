eCAL Sys Client provides the client for the eCAL Sys Host Applications (i.e. [eCAL Sys GUI](/using_ecal/applications/ecal-sys/ecal_sys_gui/) or [eCAL Sys CLI](/using_ecal/applications/ecal-sys/ecal_sys_cli/)).
Start this application on all machines, that shall be remote controlled.

eCAL Sys Client is not needed on the machine that runs the eCAL Sys Host Application.

<Aside type="caution" title="Important">
   The eCAL Sys Client is a remote-control application with no authentication.
   If you are annoyed by accepting this security implication at startup, you can start eCAL Sys Client with:

   ```shell
      ecal_sys_client --auto-accept-security-risk
   ```
