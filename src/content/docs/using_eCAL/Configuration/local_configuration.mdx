Using eCAL in local mode can be benefitial

- to avoid network congestion if the data is not needed on other machines
- to make eCAL work in VPN and Firewall scenarios where non-local traffic is blocked

To switch eCAL to local mode, edit your `ecal.ini` and change the following settings:

- Windows: `C:\ProgramData\eCAL\ecal.ini`
- Ubuntu: `/etc/ecal/ecal.ini`
```ini
   [network]
   network_enabled           = false
   multicast_ttl             = 0
```
