To switch eCAL to cloud mode, edit your `ecal.ini` and change the following settings:

- Windows: `C:\ProgramData\eCAL\ecal.ini`
- Ubuntu: `/etc/ecal/ecal.ini`
```ini
   [network]
   network_enabled           = true
   multicast_ttl             = 2
```

<Aside type="danger" title="Important">
Don't forget to set your multicast routes and make sure your hostname resolution works on all machines!
